### File structure

- `.env.example` - Example environment variable file, automatically gets used as default `.env`
- `.npmrc` - Ensure we use exact versions when adding things to `package.json`
- `.nvmrc` - Define the recommended node version
- `package-lock.json` - Broken JSON file. This is kept in the repo to force an error when using `npm`, so the developer knows to use `yarn` instead.
