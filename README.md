```bash
# node 12+ is required, if you have nvm, simply run:
nvm install

# then, it's pretty simple
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Stack

### Tools

- `node >= 12` - No real reason to use Node 12 as the minimum version, but it's currently LTS so why not
- `yarn` - I personally like yarn more than `npm`. Syntax is cleaner, installing is faster, overall is just pleasant.

### File structure

- `.env.example` - Example environment variable file, automatically gets used as default `.env`
- `.npmrc` - Ensure we use exact versions when adding things to `package.json`
- `.nvmrc` - Define the recommended node version
- `package-lock.json` - Broken JSON file. This is kept in the repo to force an error when using `npm`, so the developer knows to use `yarn` instead.

### Dependencies

- `lodash` - Helper functions for common JS problems
- `next` - Meta-framework

- `prettier` - Make code look nice automatically
- `shelljs` - Cross-platform Unix commands that can be used in scripts
